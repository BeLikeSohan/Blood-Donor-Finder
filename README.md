# Blood Donor Finder

Blood Donor Finder is an web application written in **PHP** in backend and **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** with the help of **Bootstrap** and **FlatUI**. It uses **mySQL** as database backend. It was one of my hobby project I have made to perticipate **National Science and Technology Fair 2018**. I am no longer contributing this as therefor I am publishing all the codes here as a **Open Source Contribution**.

### Language and framework use

I have used PHP to write the backend. Used Bootstrap to design the front-end and as I am not a designer, the design is ugly(maybe).

### How to run

Everything is configured, just get the source on your localhost root folder and fire the server.
One more thing, there is a **localhost.sql** file in the **DATABASE_BACKUP** folder, import it usinh PHPMYADMIN.

### A Note
The app is not completed, some functions will work and some will not. But the bareminimum funcion will work as they meant to be. Feel free to investigate and use these codes. It is one of my gift toward the Open Source Community.
